# CSS-Git
Mirroring Git

This Repository is based off an in-class project for DevMountain Web Development Immersion.

The project's purpose was to use CSS to create a basic HTML file to create a mirror of our GitHub profile page.

In using some basic CSS tools that we're discussed, my focus on this project is to create the most efficient CSS I can.
